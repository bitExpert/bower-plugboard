# mntyjs

mntyjs is a lightweight plugin system based on require.js, jQuery and Base.js
which is designed for easy-to-use implementation purpose.

## Quick start

Add the mntyjs to the head of the page:
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/mnty.js"/></script>


mntyjs will automatically register to the document ready event and will immediately run as soon
as the document is ready. Also it registers to the window unload event and will destroy itself and all used plugin
instances.


More docs will come soon...
